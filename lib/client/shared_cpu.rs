// This is thread safe due to two reasons:
//
// 1. The VGA struct is not mutable and we don't care about locking it while reading from it, we
//    can't get invalid VGA state by reading from it.
// 2. get_cpu can only have one active mutable reference at a time, so we can't have two threads
//    with mutable access to the CPU at the same time.
// 
// This can whole struct could've been circumvented by using Mutex<Cpu>, however this would lock
// the cpu thread while sending the VGA image, which slows down the emulator a lot. 
//
// The behavior this is emulating is in essence contrary to Rust goals, that's why we need to use
// unsafe here
//
// IMPORTANT: Only VGA is thread safe, no other io devices. THIS IS IMPORTANT!!! Don't add more IO
// devices here in the future unless you make them thread safe
